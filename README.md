# machine-learning-realworld-projects

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

## The goal of this repository is to:


Build strong Machine Learning foundations

Understand when, why, and how to use each ML algorithm

Apply ML to real‑world, business‑driven problems

Develop engineering and decision‑making skills, not just model accuracy

This is not a tutorial repo. It is a learning‑by‑building ML engineering playbook.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

This repository follows a progressive 3‑layer learning approach used in real ML teams:

## 1️⃣ Algorithm‑Focused Projects

Each algorithm is implemented as a standalone project on a real‑world dataset.

### Goal:

Deep understanding of the algorithm

Strengths, weaknesses, and assumptions

## 2️⃣ Multi‑Algorithm Comparative Projects

Multiple algorithms are applied to the same problem.

### Goal:

Compare performance

Understand bias–variance trade‑offs

Learn interpretability vs accuracy decisions

## 3️⃣ Mixed‑Algorithm ML Systems

### End‑to‑end ML systems where algorithm choice depends on:

Data characteristics

Business constraints

Scalability and latency

### Goal:

Learn real‑world ML decision making

Think like an ML Engineer, not just a model builder
